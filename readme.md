## Abstract
Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are emerging as an energy-efficient alternative to traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs) due to their unique spike-based event-driven nature. Coding is crucial in SNNs as it converts external input stimuli into spatio-temporal feature sequences. However, most existing deep SNNs rely on direct coding that generates powerless spike representation and lacks the temporal dynamics inherent in human vision. Hence, we introduce Gated Attention Coding (GAC), a **plug-and-play module** that leverages the multi-dimensional gated attention unit to efficiently encode inputs into powerful representations before feeding them into the SNN architecture. GAC functions as a **preprocessing layer** that does not disrupt the spike-driven nature of the SNN, making it amenable to efficient neuromorphic hardware implementation with minimal modifications. Through an observer model theoretical analysis, we demonstrate GAC's attention mechanism improves temporal dynamics and coding efficiency. Experiments on CIFAR10/100 and ImageNet datasets demonstrate that GAC achieves **state-of-the-art** accuracy with remarkable efficiency. Notably, we improve top-1 accuracy by **3.10\%** on CIFAR100 with only 6-time steps and **1.07\%** on ImageNet while reducing energy usage to 66.9\% of the previous works. To our best knowledge, it is the first time to explore the **attention-based dynamic coding schem**e in deep SNNs, with exceptional effectiveness and efficiency on large-scale datasets.

## Prerequisites
The Following Setup is tested and it is working:
 * Python 3.7
 * Pytorch 1.8.0
 * Cuda 10.2

## Description
 * use a triangle-like surrogate gradient `ZIF` in `models/layer.py` for step function forward and backward.

 * The 0-th and 1-th dimension of snn layer's input and output are batch-dimension and time-dimension. 

 * The most straightforward way of training higher quality models is by increasing their size. In this work, we would like to see that deepening network structures could get rid of the degradation problem and always be a trustworthy way to achieve satisfying accuracy for the direct training of SNNs.

 * This repository contains the source code for the training of our MS-ResNet on ImageNet. The models are defined in `models/MS_ResNet.py` .

1. Change the data paths `vardir,traindir` to the image folders of ImageNet/CIFAR dataset.
2. For CIFAR dataset, to train the model, please run  `run.sh`.
3. For ImageNet dataset, to train the model, please run  `run.sh` or `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=GPU_IDs python -m torch.distributed.launch --master_port=1234 --nproc_per_node=NUM_GPU_USED train_amp.py -net resnet34 -b 256 -lr 0.1` .
`-net` option supports `resnet18/34` .
